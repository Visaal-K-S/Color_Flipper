Hi guys this is my first project using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This project is picking a colour randomly using an algorithm written in JavaScript and making it as main page background colour and display the name or hex code of the same colour in main page.
In Simple page already 7 colours have been given as an array in JavaScript in "simple.js" file, so when you click the "click me" button it automatically choses one colour among them and makes it as pages background colour.
In Hex tab algorithm is written so that it would select a random colour from 16,777,216 possible colours and makes it as its background colour.
