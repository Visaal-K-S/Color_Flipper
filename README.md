Hi guys this is my first project using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
In this project in simple tab already 6 colours have been given as input, so when you click the "click me" button it automatically choses one color among them and makes it as pages background color.
In Hex tab algorithm is written so that it would select a random color from 16,777,216 possible colors and make it as its backgorund color.
